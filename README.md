# polymorphism
Polymorphism is the principle by which two or more classes derived from the same superclass can invoke methods that have the same identification, signature, but different behaviors, specialized for each derived class, using for that purpose a reference to an object of the superclass type. Overload is not a type of polymorphism, because with overload the method signature must have different arguments, a requirement that violates the concept of Polymorphism mentioned above.

Generally speaking, polymorphism means multiple shapes. In the case of Object Orientation, polymorphism denotes a situation in which an object can behave in different ways when receiving a message, depending on its creation type.
